INTRODUCTION:
This is the DPL(Dynamic Parser Library), also called DynParser.
DPL is a library written for C++, to give a simple API for programming with
formal languages. Simplicity is obtained by working directly with BNFs
(Baccus-Nauer Form, also called Baccus Normal Form), and by not using a
precompilation step as most other parser frameworks.
